# React Native Concepts
React Native concepts challenge applied for the GoStack Bootcamp

## :rocket: About the challenge

In this challenge, I've must create an application to practice what I have learned in React Native!

Now I must continue to develop the application that will store my portfolio repositories, which I have already developed the backend using Node.js, and in the last challenge with ReactJS.

## :hammer: Do you want to check it out?

Clone the repository:

```sh
  $ git clone https://github.com/paulo-carvalho93/conceitos-reactnative.git
```

If you are emulating on iOS, in your project folder, navigate to the ios folder and run the following commands to install all dependencies for iOS.
```sh
  $ cd ios
  $ pod install
  $ yarn start # or npm start
  $ yarn run react-native run-ios # or npm run react-native run-ios
  
```

If you are emulating on Android with Android Studio run the following commands:

```sh
  $ cd conceitos-reactjs
  # Installing project dependencies
  $ yarn # or npm install
  
  # Running unit tests
  $ yarn test # or npm test

  # Start Android Emulator
  $ yarn start # or npm start
  $ yarn run react-native run-android # or npm run react-native run-android
  ```
  
  Attention: You need the back-end running to create new repositories.
